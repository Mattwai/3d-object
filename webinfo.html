EVIDENCE OF DESIGNING YOUR WEBSITE<br>
    
        -	What content and where?<br>
For my navigation bar I have chosen to put it on the right side of the page. This is because when looking at a lot of popular websites I have found that this is the layout I have found I think looks best and works for my website. For the majority of my images I put in the centre of the website because that is where the image will be most prominent. <br><br>

-	Plan your navigation – how does it look like (inspiration)<br>
Originally, I used a side nav bar but to make my website most appealing I changed the navigation into hover-able side nav buttons.<br><br>

-	Plan your assets (do you need to use someone else’s 3D objects to add to your web pages)<br>
I don't think I need to use someone else's 3D object to add to my web pages because I think I have enough pages on my website.<br><br>
        
-	Feedback on your website?<br>
Teacher:<br>
“Simple, but clean and professional looking website. The colours of your navigation do not seem to show - perhaps I am looking at an old version. Complete the content of your pages, and work on the evidence required by the standard.”<br><br>
        
Additional information to do with this Website's development can be found on the "Guide to Documentation".<br>
