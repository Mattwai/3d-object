	3D MODELLING:<br><br>
The 3 design elements I am focusing on are:<br>
-	Colour<br>
-	Shape<br>
-	Texture<br><br>
The tool/Application I use to make my 3d object is called Blender<br><br>

In Blender I used a variety of different tools and options to form my object<br>
I used tools such as:<br>
-   Basic Mesh objects<br>
-   Bevel (to smooth out the lines)<br>
-   Material (to add colour)<br>
-   Texture (to add and bake in image textures into my object)<br>
        etc.<br><br>

To test my 3d object I used the htc vive.<br><br>


I think my 3d Object is fit for purpose because my obejct follows the specifications, it is of near professional quality, it is original ( not a pre-existing objects.) etc. <br><br>


To embed a 3d object into html, when uploading the 3d object to sketchfab, there is an option once uploaded which generates the code to put into the html which will embed the object into the website.<br><br>

Legal/Ethical/Moral issues to do with my 3d Object<br>
My 3d object is inspired by the sword King Arthur pulled out of the stone. Since the story of King Arthur is a part of English mythology it is in the public domain and does not apply to the copyright laws. However, morally when identifying the creator of King Arthur most attribute it to Geoffrey of Monmouth who wrote the popular 12th century book, “History of the kings of Britain”. This was the first life story depicting Arthur and his sword Caliburn, later known as Excalibur.
